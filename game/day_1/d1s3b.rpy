    text "{b}The Mexican Grey Wolf{/b}\n\nI had an interesting internal debate as to whether to include the Mexican Grey Wolf in this book. Officially, the wolf has not been seen in the area since 1970. However, several more recent reports have claimed sighting these majestic beasts in the Kingston area. None have been confirmed, and no photographic evidence has been found, but these intriguing wolves are a personal interest of mine, so I shall include them.\nThese animals are small for wolves and typically have a narrow skull and dark pelt. If you come across a wolf, any wolf, remember that these are not dogs, despite any outward resemblance. They need to be treated with the utmost respect at all times. They are not your friendly puppy.":
