    m "You're firing me?!"

    "I hate it when Marley cries."

    "The problem is that she's very good at faking it. I've seen her turn on the waterworks at the drop of a hat."

    r "I'm sorry, Marley. But the fact is that 'Ronald Kitzinger's Supernatural Detective Agency' is on its last legs. We're only getting offers for cheap, difficult work like the last job..."

    r "{i}*Sigh*{/i} I can't pay rent for this office. They've turned the lights off at my apartment. I ain't got no choice but to dissolve the business."
    m "No, Ron! You can't! You— you've got to fight—"
    r "There's nothing I can do! Oh please, cut the tears. We both know you're faking it!"
    m "How can you say that? First you fire me, now you tell me I'm not allowed to cry?"
    r "You're faking it!"
    m "You're heartless, Ron!"

    "Oh crap. Maybe she ain't faking it."

    show ron sad at left with dissolve

    r "Look Mar, it ain't my fault! We've got those big corporations flooding the market, and we've got those terrible fake reviews– Another one was put up today!"

    "I fumble awkwardly for my phone, pull it out of my pocket, and get Yelf up."

    r "Now, we're out $300 and I haven't slept for the last three weeks because of the constant wailing!'"
    r "Now, we ain't had a banshee call since last year, and that customer was more than happy with our services!"
    r "I've asked the site to take 'em down, but they're taking their sweet time with it. I reckon it's too late; the damage has been done. I'm sorry, Marley!"

    "As she sobs in my chair, I can't stop my eyes from wandering around the room. They snag on the framed newspaper clippings I had hung up."

    "'New detective exorcizes ghost of the Perganon Museum.'"

    "'Rising star of the supernatural detective world vanquishes the vampire of New Malt.'"

    r "Oh. Thanks."

    "Danny. My childhood friend."

    "I pick up the phone."

    b "Hey Ron! Ronald! My main man, Ron!"
    r "Hey Danny. How you been?"
    b "Oh peachy! You?"
    r "Uh... yep. Yeah. Just dandy. Anyway, what can I do for you?"
    b "Well, I've got a job for you!"
    r "A... a job? Where?"
    b "Well, uh... here. In Kingston."

    show ron moody at center with dissolve

    r "Danny, you know how I feel about that place."

    "I can't even say that name of my hometown. I left it when I was eighteen and ain't looked back since."

    b "I know, I know, but just hear me out! Kingston keeps being attacked by ghouls!"

    show ron confused at center with dissolve

    "That makes me pause."

    r "Ghouls?"
    b "Yeah. Someone's been raising the dead! Only like two or three at a time. I asked my mom, the {i}mayor{/i}—"
    r "Yes, Danny, I know your mom's the stinking mayor."
    b "Well, I got her to agree to give you the case. It's yours if you want it."
    r "Danny, I don't—"
    b "And the price tag is nothing to sniff at."

    "This catches my attention."

    r "Oh yeah? How much?"
    b "Five hundred thousand upon completion of the case."

    show ron blushing at center with dissolve

    r "Jesus Christ!"
    b "That's the standard fee for 'The Dead Busters.' And I told Mom you were a hundred times better than them."

    show ron neutral at center with dissolve

    "I'm tempted. So darn tempted. If I take this job, it might just save the business. But..."

    r "I can't do it, Danny. I can't go back."
    b "I think there's one thing that might just change your mind."

    show ron moody at center with dissolve

    r "Danny—"
    b "Just listen. I've looked into it myself a bit, and I think I already know who did it. It's an old friend of ours."

    show ron confused at center with dissolve

    r "...Who?"
    b "Seb Daley."

    show ron blushing at center with dissolve

    "The name stops my heart. It echoes around my head. It wraps itself around my throat, makes my breath catch."
    "Sebastian Daley. Me and Danny went to school with him. He was smart. Handsome. Funny. Kind."
    "...and the reason I left that darned town. The reason I never went back."
    "I force myself to breathe again."

    show ron neutral at center with dissolve

    r "Can you lend me the money for two plane tickets?"
    b "YES!"

    "Danny is so loud that I have to pull the phone from my ear for a second."

    b "I'll organize everything right away. I'm on it! Can you set off today? Don't worry, I'll sort it out. I'll call you when I've got it all ready!"

    #SFX- Dial tone

    "Before I can say a word, the dial tone hums in my ear. I slowly put the phone in its cradle, then lean back in my chair, taking a deep breath."

    show ron moody at center with dissolve

    r "Crap."

    "I'd sworn to never go back to that damned backwater town. But the job looks easy enough, nothing I haven't done a hundred times before. The only complication is Seb."
    "I sigh, then reach forward and press a button on the intercom."

    r "Marley?"
    m "{i}*Sniff*{/i} Yeah? {i}*Sob sob*{/i}"
    r "You're unfired."
    m "Oh thank god! Fake crying always gives me a headache."
    r "Marley!"

    "I sigh, rubbing a hand over my forehead."

    r "Whatever. Go to your apartment and pack a bag, we're visiting hell."
    m "Ooh, sounds fun!"
