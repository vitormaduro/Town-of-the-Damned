    b "You sure you can play nice with Terry?"
    r "Yeah, don't worry. I can play nice as well as the next person."
    b "I was talking to Miss Frigid over there."

    show marley annoyed at left with dissolve

    m "What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
    b "Well, you were pretty cold to him."
    m "Oh, I'm sorry I'm not interested in hooking up with your BFF."

    show danny angry at right with dissolve

    b "Do you always have to be so rude?"

    show marley angry at left with dissolve

    m "Only for as long as you continue to be such a pain! Your precious Terry drooled over me so much I'm still wiping off his spit!"
    r "He was always a ladies' man in school. Seemed to think he was God's gift to women."

    show marley frustrated at left with dissolve

    m "Well, I hope God still has the receipt, because I want to return him."

    show danny confused at right with dissolve

    b "Why do you hate him so much?"

    show marley serious at left with dissolve

    m "I've met people like him before. All around the world, there are Terrys. People who think they're so perfect that no one could ever say 'no' to them. Terrys think that everyone wants to either be them or be {i}with{/i} them. And the reality is that anyone sensible who has met a Terry knows that whatever angle they look at the prat from, the truth is clear to see—the Terry is trash."
    b "You ever considered that maybe you're not a people person?"
    m "Oh, I'm a people person alright. Just not a {i}stupid{/i} people person."

    show marley moody at left with dissolve

    r "Hey, Terry."
    t "Alright, so me and my men have divided up the town. I'll give you each a partner from my posse, and then each pair will be assigned an area to monitor."
    r "Sure thing."
    t "Danny, you're with Captain Stone over there. Ron, you're with Deputy Thomas. And sugar, you're with me."

    show marley angry at left with dissolve

    m "I don't think that's such a good idea."
    t "Oh? Why not?"
    m "Well, sheriff, I have nothing but respect for you—"

    show terry blushing at right with dissolve

    t "Aw, well shucks—"
    m "And not much of that."

    show terry confused at right with dissolve

    t "Huh?"
    r "Actually, I'd like to work with you, Terry. Good opportunity to... reminisce. Chat about the old times."

    t "Oh, I see. Well, sure. That works too. Let's go—we've got downtown."
    r "Alright."
    m "Thanks, Ron."

    "For a few painful minutes, Terry and I walk silently through the streets. It's awkward as hell."

    r "So, uh... how- how you been, Terry?"
    t "Been good. You?"
    r "Good. Too."
    t "Good."

    "Jesus Christ."
    "I hate him."
    "He hates me."
    "We both know it. And at least back when we were kids, he could just punch me. And I could punch him. It was bad but it was honest. Not like now—we've grown up and have to pretend we don't loathe the sight of each other."

    t "How's the case going?"
    r "Well, we've only just started. But it's all very intriguing."
    t "I don't know, seems pretty straightforward to me."

    show ron curious at left with dissolve

    r "Oh yeah? Who do you think is the summoner, then?"
    t "I thought Danny told you? It's Seb Daley."
    r "Why do you think that?"
    t "I don't know. Call it a hunch."

    "We fall back into an awkward silence for a few minutes."
    "We reach the center of town and continue meandering our way through the dusty streets."

    t "So, uh... that secretary of yours—"
    r "Assistant."
    t "She's a real beaut'."

    show ron uncomfortable at left with dissolve

    r "Uh... I guess."
    t "It's cute to see how much she likes me."

    show ron shocked at left with dissolve

    r "Uh, what? I don't think—"
    t "It's clear as day. She's just playing hard to get."
    r "Hang on, hang on. Maybe this is a straight person thing, but let me get my head around this. If a girl acts really friendly to you, she..."
    t "Well, she likes me."
    r "Right, okay. If she acts neutral? Like, polite, but not super friendly?"
    t "Ah, well, she just wants me to try a little harder. She wants me to prove I'm worth getting all flustered about."
    r "... Uh-huh. And if she's just plain awful to you?"

    show terry smile at right with dissolve

    t "Well, then she's the best kinda gal. She wants a chase. It's a game. She loves it but pretends she doesn't. Just like your Marley. Trust me, Ron, you don't understand women. She {i}wants{/i} me."
    r "Either I {i}really{/i} don't understand straight people or you're way past confused."

    show ron neutral at left with dissolve

    "Poor Marley. I don't envy having Terry's attention."
    "Silence falls again for a few minutes, and my conversation with Danny from earlier in the day surfaces in my mind—the one about Terry losing his scholarship."

    show ron awkward at left with dissolve

    r "Danny told me about Ohio State."

    show terry serious at right with dissolve

    "The words come out of my mouth before I realize what I've said."
    "But I guess I might as well plough on."

    r "I- I'm sorry. It must have been real hard. I hope you don't... blame me for that."

    show terry smile at right with dissolve

    t "Blame you? Shucks man, of course not! Nah, me losing that scholarship was the best thing that could've happened to me!"

    show ron confused at left with dissolve

    r "Huh?"
    t "Nah. I would have been miserable at Ohio State."
    r "Really?"
    t "Ain't you noticed? This town practically worships me!"

    show ron dubious at left with dissolve

    r "Uh-huh?"
    t "See, I realized something a few years back, Ron—you and I are kinda similar."

    "What the hell?"

    r "We are?"
    t "At least in one way—we're both big fish. This is a little pond; that's why we fought so much when we were young."
    r "You mean why you beat me up all the time?"
    t "Tomayto, tomahto. But, see, when you went off to the big city, you became a big fish in a {i}huge{/i} pond. Massive. And look where it's got you—Danny told me your business is dying. Ya got no family, live in a run-down flat—"

    show ron confused at left with dissolve

    r "You seem to know a lot about me."
    t "Danny yaps on about you all the damn time."

    show ron neutral at left with dissolve

    r "Huh."
    t "But see, me, I'm a big fish that's got an itty-bitty pond all to myself. This place loves me, ain't you noticed? Believe me, if I went to that college, I would've drowned in a huge pond, just like you."
    r "I see."

    "That idiot might just have something resembling a point."

    # TODO: SFX- Radio Bleep

    "Terry's radio beeps to life at his hip."

    b "Uh— Emergency, emergency! Oh God, I don't know what I'm supposed to be saying!"

    show ron worried at left with dissolve

    t "Danny, is that you?"
    b "Terry! Oh, thank God! Can you get to the high school? Like, right now!"
    t "We're on our way!"

    "Terry and I exchange glances, then we start running."
    "The sound of our feet hitting the road echoes around us, underlined by heavy breathing."
    "We get to the high school in a few minutes."

    show danny afraid at center with dissolve

    "Danny is kneeling on the ground by the unconscious body of Captain Stone."

    show terry horrified at right with dissolve

    t "What the hell happened, Danny?"
    b "It was the ghouls! Two of them came out of that alley over there. The captain tried to stop them, but—"

    "He gestured at the prone man."

    b "They're in the school."
    t "Oh crap!"

    "I hear someone running towards us and turn to see Marley come to a stop in front of me."

    show marley concerned at left with dissolve

    m "We heard you guys on the radio—"
    r "Marley, you got your goat's blood?"
    m "Uh-huh!"
    r "Good. Go around the building and write up those runes to seal in the undead."
    m "Yes, boss!"

    show marley concerned at offscreenleft with move

    "She disappears into the night."

    t "Come on, Ron, hurry up!"

    "Following the trail of grave dirt going up the steps to the school, Terry and I run into the building that had once been my personal hell."
