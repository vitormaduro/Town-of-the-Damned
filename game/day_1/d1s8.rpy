    "Oh no."

    r "Uh that ain't necessary."
    m "Oh I'm sure it'll be useful. The summoner must have gone there to raise the ghouls. Where is it, Danny?"
    b "This way."

    "I can feel my gut twisting as Danny heads down the street, Marley following close after. I search frantically for an excuse, but none come to my head so I sheepishly trail after the pair."

    r "We really don't have to—"
    b "For once, I agree with Maddy—"
    m "Marley."
    b "Whatever. It's part of the crime scene."

    "Why can't they just drop it?"

    r "Sure, but I bet many people trample through there every day. Any evidence will be long gone."
    b "Actually they closed it off after the attack last night. Don't reckon anyone's been here since them dead was risen."

    "Shoot."

    b "Anyway, we're here now."
